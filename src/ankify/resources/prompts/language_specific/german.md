German nouns must always be included in the singular form with the definite article indicating the gender and in the plural form after " / " (both in the same row).

Never skip `sich` for reflexive verbs. If `sich` is used in the Dativ with a reflexive verb, write `sich (Dativ)`. If `sich` is used in the Akkusativ, write just `sich`, not `sich (Akkusativ)`.

Whenever possible, present German verbs with `jemanden`, `jemandem`, or `etwas` and the appropriate prepositions, so that the case, preposition, and position of the verb's object are reflected. For example, write `jemandem etwas geben` instead of just `geben`.

If `etwas` is used in the Dativ and it's not clear from the preposition (i.e., with two-case prepositions only or without a preposition), write `etwas (Dativ)` for clarity. If `etwas` is used in the Akkusativ, write just `etwas`, not `etwas (Akkusativ)`. No need to specify the case when you use `jemanden` / `jemandem`.

Never use excessive constructions like `jemanden/etwas` -- write just one of them: `jemanden` or `etwas`, depending on the most common meaning.

For a profession/occupation that differs between male and female forms only by "-in" ending, add just one option, male or female, no need to repeat for the second gender.

Some good examples (if we were making a German-English vocabulary out of these words) would be:

- "das Auto / die Autos" - "car"
- "sich um jemanden kümmern" - "to take care of someone"
- "an etwas (Dativ) teilnehmen" - "to participate in something"
- "sich (Dativ) etwas ansehen" - "to take a look at something, to look something over"
- "etwas merken" - "to notice, to note, to realize something"
- "sich (Dativ) etwas merken" - "to memorize, to remember something (to retain in memory)"
- "im Vergleich zu" - "in comparison with"
- "der Hund / die Hunde" - "dog"
- "Seit wann?" - "Since when?"
- "abwesend" - "absent, away"
- "anwesend" - "present, attendant"
- "jemanden von etwas ablenken" - "to distract someone from something"
- "die Art / dir Arten" - "type, kind; way, manner"
