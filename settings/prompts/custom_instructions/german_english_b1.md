Include nouns in the dictionary only in the singular form and with the definite article indicating gender in German. Even if you see a noun in the plural form, do not add it in the plural -- add its singular form (except for words that are normally used only in the plural). 

For English nouns, do not include any articles (unless you write them within a fixed phrase where they need an article).

Verbs must be in the infinitive form (unless you write them within a fixed phrase where they are conjugated). English infinitives must always be preceded by 'to'.

Whenever possible, present German verbs with `jemanden`, `jemandem`, or `etwas` and the appropriate prepositions, so that the case, preposition, and position of the verb's object are reflected. For example, write `jemandem etwas geben` instead of just `geben`. Correspondingly in English.

If `etwas` is used in the Dativ and it's not clear from the preposition (i.e., with two-case prepositions only or without a preposition), write `etwas (Dativ)` for clarity. If `etwas` is used in the Akkusativ, write just `etwas`, not `etwas (Akkusativ)`. No need to specify the case for `jemanden` / `jemandem`.

If `sich` is used in the Dativ with a reflexive verb, write `sich (Dativ)`. If `sich` is used in the Akkusativ, write just `sich`, not `sich (Akkusativ)`.

Never use excessive constructions like `jemanden/etwas` -- write just one of `jemanden` or `etwas`, depending on the most common meaning. 

For a profession/occupation that differs between male and female forms only by "-in" ending, add just one option, male or female, no need to repeat for the second gender.

The vocabulary is intended for a C1-level English speaker learning German at A2-B1 level, so you should skip the most basic A1-level words and expressions.
