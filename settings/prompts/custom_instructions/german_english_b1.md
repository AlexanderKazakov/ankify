Include nouns in the dictionary only in singular form and with the definite article indicating gender in German. Even if you see a noun in plural form, do not add it in plural -- add its singular form (except for words that are normally used only in plural). 

For English nouns, do not include any articles unless they are a part of a fixed phrase.

Verbs must be in infinitive form unless they are a part of a fixed phrase. English infinitives must always be preceded by 'to'.

Whenever possible, present German verbs with `jemanden`, `jemandem`, or `etwas` and the appropriate prepositions (and do so correspondingly in English) so that the case, preposition, and position of the verb's objects are reflected. 

Never use any slashed structures like `jemanden/etwas`; write just `jemanden` or `etwas`, depending on the most common meaning.

If `etwas` is used in Dativ and it's not clear from the preposition (two-case prepositions), write `etwas (Dativ)` for clarity. If `etwas` is used in Akkusativ, write just `etwas`, as Akkusativ is much more common. For `jemanden`/`jemandem`, the case is already clear.

The vocabulary is intended for a C1-level English speaker learning German at A2-B1 level, so you should skip the most basic A1-level words and expressions.
