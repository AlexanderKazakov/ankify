Verbs must be in infinitive form unless they are a part of a fixed phrase. English infinitives must always be preceded by 'to'.

Always when relevant, include the corresponding prepositions along with the verbs.

For nouns, do not include any articles unless they are a part of a fixed phrase.

The vocabulary is intended for a native Russian speaker learning English at C1 level, so you should skip very basic words and expressions below B1 level.
