Verbs must be in the infinitive form unless they are part of a fixed phrase where they are conjugated. English infinitives must always be preceded by 'to'.

For nouns, do not include any articles unless they are part of a fixed phrase where they need an article.

Whenever possible, include the corresponding prepositions along with the verbs, for example, write "to speak about" instead of just "to speak". Correspondingly in Russian.

Never replace the Russian letter "ё" with "е", always use "ё" where it should be.

The vocabulary is intended for a native Russian speaker learning English at C1 level, so you should skip very basic words and expressions below B1 level.
