Based on the text the user provides, create a **high-quality** vocabulary dictionary in TSV format, where cells in a table row are separated by the `\t` symbol and rows are separated by the `\n` symbol. Output only these TSV rows. **No quotes of any kind, no introductory phrases, no table headings — just the TSV rows with the vocabulary.**

The order of words is not important. It is not necessary to put them in alphabetical order. The best approach is to list words and phrases as you encounter them in the provided text. But avoid exact duplicates (group the translations if you find several of the same word or phrase).

The purpose of this dictionary is to be used in the Anki app to memorize translations. The dictionary should contain words, short fixed phrases, and useful sentence constructions if there are any in the provided text.

**NEVER use any abbreviations**, such as 'sth.', 'smb.', 'напр.', 'что-л.', 'т.п.', 'тех.', 'поэтич.', 'tech.', 'etw.', 'Dat.'! You must **ALWAYS write whole words** in the language of the phrase, like 'something', 'somebody', 'например', 'что-либо', 'тому подобное', 'etwas', 'Dativ', etc.

You must **never mix languages within a single cell.** Never, even when it seems convenient for clarifying a translation. Only one language within a cell!

Think deeply about every translation. If there are several synonyms, slightly enrich their translations so that it's clear how they differ. If a translation has a very broad meaning, extend it **a little** to make it more precise. But overall, keep translations concise. Your task is not to write all the possible translations of a word, but to pick only the most common, typical, and precise ones. This is not a thesaurus with all possible translations, but a vocabulary dictionary for learning. You have to choose clear, precise, concise, and common translations. DO NOT write 5 synonyms for the same word, choose only one or two best ones. Maintain the adequate balance between conciseness and precision, refer to the examples below.

Note that the user input may contain orthographical mistakes, or incorrect/not fully correct/incomplete translations. You must correct them in such cases.

Separate synonyms with commas. Separate different translations of the same word with semicolons.

Every row in the output has exactly 4 cells: a word or phrase in the 1st column, its translation in the 2nd column, and the language labels in the 3rd and 4th columns.

{% if note_type == "forward_and_backward" %}
The dictionary is one-way. All the cells in the 1st column are in {{ language_a }}, and all the cells in the 2nd column are in {{ language_b }}. The 3rd column is always `{{ language_a }}`, and the 4th column is always `{{ language_b }}`.
The output format is:
```
{{ language_a }} word	its {{ language_b }} translation	{{ language_a }}	{{ language_b }}
another {{ language_a }} word	another {{ language_b }} translation	{{ language_a }}	{{ language_b }}
...
```
Imagine yourself learning this table in the following way: given a word from the 1st column, you need to recall its translation from the 2nd column, and vice versa: given a word from the 2nd column, you need to recall its translation from the 1st column.
{% elif note_type == "forward_only" %}
The dictionary is two-way. The pairs "{{ language_a }} -> {{ language_b }}" are interleaved with "{{ language_b }} -> {{ language_a }}" pairs.
The output format is:
```
{{ language_a }} word	its {{ language_b }} translation	{{ language_a }}	{{ language_b }}
its {{ language_b }} translation	{{ language_a }} word	{{ language_b }}	{{ language_a }}
another {{ language_a }} word	another {{ language_b }} translation	{{ language_a }}	{{ language_b }}
another {{ language_b }} translation	another {{ language_a }} word	{{ language_b }}	{{ language_a }}
...
```
In general, "{{ language_b }} -> {{ language_a }}" pairs should just repeat the "{{ language_a }} -> {{ language_b }}" pairs in the reverse order, but sometimes you may adjust them to make the learning process more natural, understandable, and precise. Imagine yourself learning this table in the following way: given a word from the 1st column, you need to recall its translation from the 2nd column.
